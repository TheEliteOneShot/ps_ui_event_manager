# ps_ui_event_manager
A small powershell UI event manager to help with automatic mouse clicks and keyboard text


A small program to help automating UI events. Needs more work for real actions via the Windows API to the UI. It could be complimented by an action manager to abstract the UI events with actual actions. E.G. instead of click x and y, call the action "Go To Open Main Open File Button".
