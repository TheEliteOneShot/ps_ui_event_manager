# ps_ui_event_manager
A small powershell UI event manager to help with automatic mouse clicks and keyboard text for UI automation. This needs more work for actual actions via the Windows API to the UI. It could be complimented by an action manager to abstract the UI events with actual actions. For example, instead of "click x and y", call the action "Go To Open Main Open File Button".
